Hey there,

This webpage (https://ubc-mgem-fcor599.github.io/FCOR-599-Workshops/) contains workshop artifacts created by your FCOR 599 TA's. Many of these artifacts were initially developed as workshops, and have been archived here for your reference. 
The topics range from cartography to advanced figure development and python scripting - most of which were requested by previous cohorts of your peers. 
If you have any questions, or have suggestions for additional modules that can be included here, please talk to your FCOR 599 teaching team.
